A big fan of the gedit color theme 'Twilight' by Will Farrington, I made a pretty literal translation of it for vim here. Originally, the only changes from Farrington's scheme were that I did away with the 'dark maroon' guibg and added Pmenu colors, but it has slowly grown to incorporate even more 'Vim-isms'.
